Python projects using the Django Framework


## Checkbook Project
In this project, I created an application that keeps track of various bank accounts. The user is able to create an account that contains information such as First
Name, Last Name, and Starting Balance. The user is then able to add transactions to the account including information such as the Date of Transaction, Type of 
Transaction (e.g., Deposit or Withdrawal), Amount, Description, and the Account it applies to. The application allows the user to see their current bank account 
balance and all transactions that apply to it. The user is also able to select from the main page to view an account - with a drop down form made up of names, 
or create a new account.

## AppBuilder9000 Live Project
This project was done with a team of developers to create a large application made of various smaller applications. The app I worked on specifically was a registry
of characters ("villagers") in the popular Nintendo game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Using PyCharm, the Django Framework, MVC design pattern, and project management
methodologies via Azure DevOps, My registry included forms for signing up to the application and creating a user profile based on information the user input to the 
database, then taking that information and displaying it beautifully in the proper view. Using Template Language, the code and styling for each page in my app was clean
and aesthetically pleasing.
